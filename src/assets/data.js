    desc: "As a programmer, you think in objects. Now your database does too. MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. We believe this is the most natural way to think about data, and is much more expressive and powerful than the traditional row/column model. Powerful query language Rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field, no matter how nested it may be within a document. Support for aggregations and other modern use-cases such as geo-based search, graph search, and text search. Queries are themselves JSON, and thus easily composable. No more concatenating strings to dynamically generate SQL queries. MongoDB Atlas - the global cloud database MongoDB Atlas is the multi-cloud database service for MongoDB available on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. Best-in-class automation and built-in proven practices provide continuous availability, elastic scalability, and support with regulatory compliance. More than just a database MongoDB is a true data platform with a comprehensive suite of tools to make working with data remarkably easy for everyone, from developers to analysts to data scientists.",

First released in 2014, Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms, it uses the Objective-C runtime library, which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.",
